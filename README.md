Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics using machine learning algorithms. The model is built using Python and leverages libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. It analyzes factors like age, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels, and glucose concentration to determine the risk of diabetes.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for accurate predictions by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical data.

Model Development: Implemented various machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build a robust prediction model.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability.

Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib to create visual representations of data distributions, model performance, and feature importance.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive way for users to input health data and receive immediate predictions regarding diabetes risk.

Usage
This tool can be used by healthcare professionals, data scientists, and individuals interested in health analytics to predict diabetes risk based on a set of health indicators. It serves as an early warning system, helping users make informed decisions about their health.
